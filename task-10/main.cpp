    //
    // - Prompt the user for input, for the grade of each component of assessment 1
    // - Prompt the user for input, for the grade of each component of assessment 2
    // - Provide a detailed breakdown of:
    //      - List the overall percentage of each assessment
    //      - Their overall grade after percentage weighting
    //      - Output which CRG band they fit into, for each criterion

    //Invalid input should be detected and handled after prompting. For example,
    //if the input grade "-1" is given, the user should be reprompted to enter the
    //grade again.

    //Furthermore, please use structs and arrays where appropriate to model
    //the different assessment components.
